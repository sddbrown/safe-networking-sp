# Version 2.0

- Intermittently, there is a concurrency error that will show up in the sfn.log as an ERROR and it will create subsequent ERROR messages as the system cannot work with the domain details document correctly.  To remedy this, as it *could* slow down performance, delete the domain document in question. Contact the account team or SP-Solutions with help on this matter.
